<h1>Of Night and Ruin</h1>


<!-- ===============================
     PRESENT
================================ -->

<div class="present">

<p>
I did not expect the house to remain intact.
</p>

<p>
Time rarely grants abandoned places such restraint. Dust settled evenly across the floors and furnishings, untouched by recent passage. Nothing appeared disturbed. Even the air felt settled, as though movement itself had long ago been discouraged.
</p>

<p>
The silence did not feel empty.
Only patient.
</p>

<p>
I moved through the rooms slowly, uncertain why care felt necessary in a place so clearly deserted. Each sound seemed absorbed before it could fully exist.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere beneath the stillness lingered the impression that departure here had not been hurried.
Only postponed.
</p>

</div>



<!-- ===============================
     MEMORY
================================ -->

<div class="memory">

<p>
The study lay at the rear of the house.
</p>

<p>
A desk stood beneath a shuttered window, its surface arranged with deliberate order. Papers rested where they had last been handled. A candle remained half-burned, wax hardened in slow descent along its base.
</p>

<p>
A fountain pen lay beside a shallow groove worn permanently into the wood.
</p>

<p>
Nothing suggested abandonment.
Only interruption.
</p>

<p>
Among these objects rested a red leather volume.
</p>

<!-- ===============================
     MANUSCRIPT (THE JOURNAL)
================================ -->

<div class="journal-entry">

<p>
The age grows restless beyond tolerance.
</p>

<p>
Light encroaches where darkness once ruled unchallenged. Survival now favors absence over presence.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I withdraw.
</p>

<p>
Let the centuries turn without my witness.
</p>

<p>
This place shall remain sufficient.
</p>

<p>
When quiet returns to the world, I may walk within it once more.
</p>

<p>
Until then, memory sleeps.
</p>

</div>



<!-- ===============================
     RETURN
================================ -->

<div class="present">

<p>
I became aware of the room again only gradually.
</p>

<p>
The house stood empty.
Yet the final line lingered long after I closed the book.
</p>

<p>
Until then.
</p>
